## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Initial setup

Clone the git repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/umcconnell/function-approximators.git
cd function-approximators/
```

Start a simple webserver (e.g. with python3, node):

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Done!
